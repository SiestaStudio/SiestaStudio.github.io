[HTTP Cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie), as you probably already now, are pieces of data stored on our computers
by the websites we visit to store information such pages visited before, login status, our preferences, forms filled in order to

There are kind of cookies, called [third-party cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Third-party_cookie),
set by a website other than the one we are currently on. Third-party cookies can be used for right things,
such as with websites that have follow or like buttons, blogs with comments served through a separate system, etc.
But there also cookies used for tracking us. They can be usually used for analyze network traffic, and that is good,
but also for tracking us by advertising networks, search engines or social networks that we may not expect.

According with the official standards, browsers should be block third party cookies by default, but almost all permit them.
The good news is that all main browsers provide ways to control cookies at any time, allowing, blocking or removing them.
Please refer to your browser's help for further information.
